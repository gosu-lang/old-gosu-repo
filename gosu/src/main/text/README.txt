WELCOME

Thanks for downloading Gosu.  You are using version ${project.version}.

QUICK INSTALL

1. Confirm that you have Java version 1.6 (Sun/Oracle J2SE release 6) or
later on your computer. Gosu works with both the JRE version and the 
SDK version of Java. For Java downloads, visit http://java.com 

2. Expand the gosu.zip download file into its own directory.

3. Run the platform-specific launch scripts in the /bin directory of the 
Gosu directory. For example, gosu.cmd for Windows users.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

If you run the Gosu command-line tool without any arguments, Gosu 
opens a code editor that lets you create and run Gosu scripts. This editor
understands the Gosu type system. It offers code completion of Gosu
code based on the available Gosu and Java types when you type a "." or
CTRL+SPACE.

Gosu also includes an interactive shell for writing and running lines of Gosu
by using the -i option:
   gosu -i
   
For more information, refer to the documentation for the Gosu shell:
